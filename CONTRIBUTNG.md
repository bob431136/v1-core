Overlay Protocol is an open source endeavor 

## Setting up your environment

Our project uses build systems Brownie (pre summer 2022) and Foundry.

## Workflow for contributions

New features must achieve full test coverage of their contributions. At the same time, they must not break any prior tests. 

Once a feature is complete, a pull request can be submitted for review, requiring the sign off of two core contributors.

Once successful signoff has occurred, congratulations. You are a successful contributor.
