# [Spearbit Audit Review](https://github.com/overlay-market/v1-core/blob/main/audits/spearbit/audit.pdf)

## Findings Review

### 5.1.1 Use `unchecked` in `TickMath.sol` and `FullMath.sol`

>*Recommendation*: Add an unchecked block to the following functions in TickMath.sol and FullMath.sol:
>
>â€¢ getSqrtRatioAtTick()
>
>â€¢ getTickAtSqrtRatio()
>
>â€¢ mulDiv()
>
>â€¢ mulDivRoundingUp()

Check: 
- getSqrtRatioAtTick() -> OK
- getTickAtSqrtRatio() -> NOT USED
- mulDiv() -> OK
- mulDivRoundingUp() -> NOT USED

Note: We have custom versions of TickMath.sol and FullMath.sol but we have copy pasted functions that we are not using ðŸ¤”.

### 5.1.2 Liquidation might fail

>Fixed in commit [082c6c7](https://github.com/overlay-market/v1-core/tree/082c6c71ea3f65a0ce20cae4a9ca895656a0690e).
